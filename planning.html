          <h2>Step One: Convening a Planning Committee</h2>

          <p>To make decisions when preparing to host an Inclusion Project event, it is important to first convene an event Planning Committee that is comprised of diverse members. It will be different if the event is at a school or a community organization. If the event is at a school, the planning committee members of your local school division such as building administrators, educators, staff, youth with and without disabilities, and parents and community disability organization partners if appropriate.  It is important that this group be inclusive of diverse individuals who are interested in inclusion/disability awareness and anti-bullying.</p>

          <p>There are several ways to form your planning committee -- ask specific individuals, recruit volunteers, or have an application process.  If the event will be held during DHAM, the committee should be formed no later than eight to nine months prior to October and should plan to meet monthly at a minimum.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>Pre-work for the facilitator to do or ensure is done prior to the first Inclusion Project Planning Committee meeting includes, but is not limited to:
            <ul>
              <li>Who should serve on the Inclusion Project Planning Committee?</li>
              <li>Is there a ‘champion’ who will make sure the Inclusion Project event happens?</li>
              <li>Do all potential members of the Inclusion Project Planning Committee have the information they need to plan the event?</li>
              <li>What process will be used to ensure everyone has input into decisions regarding the Inclusion Project?</li>
              <li>Who will facilitate and record different parts of the planning meetings?</li>
              <li>Who will keep track of the tasks in order to have a successful event?</li>
              <li>When will the Inclusion Project Planning Committee meet to ensure full participation by all members?</li>
              <li>Does the Inclusion Project Planning Committee meeting location meet requirements for the members of the committee, (i.e., disability accommodations, wall space for chart paper, and screen for projection)?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>Communication among all members of the Inclusion Project Planning Committee needs to be respectful of disabilities and positive.  Below is information on using Person-First Language, some suggestions on how to effectively manage relationships when youth are represented on a committee, and the use of ground rules that can be helpful in keeping a meeting on track.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Person First Language -->
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <div class="well">
            <h3>Person-First Language</h3>

            <p>Language and labels can devalue a person as less than, not like us, which can lead to stereotyping, discrimination and bullying.  Using person-first language simply puts the person before the disability. For example, say:
                <ul>
                     <li>People with disabilities; not the handicapped or disabled</li>
                     <li>John has Down Syndrome; not he has Downs or he is retarded</li>
                     <li>Sarah uses a wheelchair; not Sarah’s wheelchair bound or confined to a wheelchair</li>
                     <li>He has a brain injury; not he is brain damaged</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Person-first language is not about being politically correct.  It is about respect and treating people the way we want to be treated.  More information on using person-first language and helpful handouts can be found at <a href="http://www.disabilityisnatural.com" target="_blank"><strong>www.disabilityisnatural.com</strong></a>.</p>

            <h3>Ground Rules</h3>
              <p>Many meeting facilitators find it helpful to establish ground rules to govern meeting behavior.  Typically, the meeting attendees develop the list at the first meeting.  In order to get the buy-in from the Planning Committee members, you may want to ask them to develop a list of ground rules.  Examples of ground rules include:
                <ul>
                    <li>No jargon</li>
                    <li>Have fun</li>
                    <li>Start and end of time</li>
                    <li>Do unto others…</li>
                    <li>Listen with your ears</li>
                    <li>One person speaking at a time</li>
                    <li>Ask (for what you need, for help to pursue questions)</li>
                    <li>Everyone contributes</li>
                    <li>Use Person-First language</li>
                    <li>Cell phones off or on vibrate</li>
                    <li>Limit sidebar conversations</li>

      <!-- Step 2 -->
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2>Step Two:  Setting a Goal and Vision for the Inclusion Project</h2>

        <p>During the initial planning meeting, the Inclusion Project Planning Committee should set a general goal and vision for the Inclusion Project.  This will ensure that all team members have a common understanding for the event that can be communicated to the entire school body and/or community.</p>

        <div class="well">
          <p>One way to develop a vision statement is to ask the Inclusion Project Planning Committee:
            <ul>
              <li>What do you believe is the purpose of the Inclusion Project?</li>
              <li>What is the message students, teachers, and people in the building (and/or community) will walk away with at the end of the day?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        
          <br>

          <h3>Sample Vision Statement:</h3>
          <p class="lead"><em>"Students will gain a greater understanding of what it means to belong to a school that welcomes all people."</em></p>
        </div>

        <hr>
      </div> 
      <!-- END Step 2 -->

      <!-- Step 3 -->  
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2>Step Three:  Establishing an Inclusion Project Agenda</h2>

        <p>The Inclusion Project Planning Committee will need to decide if the event(s) will be held during a day (all day, part of a day), a week or a month (or even monthly).  Pitfalls to avoid include, but are not limited to (1) checking the calendar to prevent scheduling an Inclusion Project event(s) to coincide with any religious observance that may exclude some members of your school or community, and (2) reviewing the school’s master calendar to prevent scheduling conflicts with school holidays and sporting events. Once decisions are made on the date(s) and how long the event(s) will run, the Inclusion Project Planning Committee should draft an agenda.</p>

        <div class="well">
          <p>The committee should take the following into consideration:</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Arrival of students in parking lot and walking into the school -- what do they see?</li>
              <li>Going to class -- what is in the hallways?</li>
              <li>Classrooms -- where are the activities taking place?</li>
              <li>Lunch -- what are the students talking about?</li>
              <li>End of the day -- how are students reflecting about the activities of the day?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

        <hr>
      </div>
      <!-- END Step 3 --> 

      <!-- Step 4 -->
      <div class="col-md-12">
          
        <h2>Step Four:  Developing a Work plan</h2>

        <p>Once an agenda has been drafted, the Inclusion Project Planning Committee may find it helpful to identify a list of tasks to be completed by whom and when.  It is important to remember that the whole school/community organization should participate in the Inclusion Project.  This is not a project or event just by or for the special education department or classrooms.  This may require a concerted effort preparing general education teachers and all school staff in disability basics.</p>

        <div class="well">
          <p>This is an example of a work plan. The report from the Inclusion Project pilots in Northumberland and Radford may provide additional ideas:</p>
