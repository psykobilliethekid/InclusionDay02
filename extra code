									Elementary School: Day-in-the-Life Activity People Needed to Organize:
									One-Two (Physical Education Teacher, Teaching Assistants) People
									Needed to Carry Out: At least six (6) students, volunteers Recommended
									Setting(s): Gymnasium, outdoors, hallway Materials Needed: Manual
									wheelchairs, guide canes, obstacles (e.g., cones, chairs, ladder,
									student’s legs, stairs) Time Needed: 60 minutes Goal: To experience
									what a person with a physical or sensory disability goes through on a
									daily basis while moving around in school. Teacher Preparation: 1)
									Survey the school to find ways that the school itself can be used to
									demonstrate obstacles for someone in a wheelchair. 2) Set up obstacles
									for the students to navigate around while blindfolded or using a
									wheelchair. (Examples: moving through student filled hallways, finding
									an accessible entrance, picking up things off of the ground or
									reaching objects that are up high.) 3) Set up a specific route
									through/around the school or classroom that includes various
									obstacles, have a specific goal in mind such as retrieving a book from
									the library or getting their lunch in the cafeteria. 4) Schedule the
									activity, secure equipment, and plan logistics. Step By Step
									Description: 1) Explain the activity to the students and demonstrate
									how to use a guide cane and wheelchair. 2) Have students maneuver a
									wheelchair or use a guide cane to navigate through the obstacles set
									up around the classroom or school. The other students should either
									watch or participate by becoming an obstacle (for example: a crowded
									hallway). 3) After the activity bring the students back together and
									have them discuss what they experienced and what they learned from the
									activity. Reflection Questions: 1) What are two words that describe
									how you felt during the activity? Go around the room and have each
									student share his/her two words. 2) What did you think about while
									trying to move around in the wheelchair? 3) Was it easy to get around
									the obstacles while blindfolded and using a guide cane? 4) Did it take
									longer to complete activities while you were in a wheelchair or
									blindfolded? Authors: Elementary Work Group

										Elementary School: Day-in-the-Life Activity People Needed to
										Organize: One-Two (Physical Education Teacher, Teaching Assistants)
										People Needed to Carry Out: At least six (6) students, volunteers
										Recommended Setting(s): Gymnasium, outdoors, hallway Materials
										Needed: Manual wheelchairs, guide canes, obstacles (e.g., cones,
										chairs, ladder, student’s legs, stairs) Time Needed: 60 minutes Goal:
										To experience what a person with a physical or sensory disability
										goes through on a daily basis while moving around in school. Teacher
										Preparation: 1) Survey the school to find ways that the school itself
										can be used to demonstrate obstacles for someone in a wheelchair. 2)
										Set up obstacles for the students to navigate around while
										blindfolded or using a wheelchair. (Examples: moving through student
										filled hallways, finding an accessible entrance, picking up things
										off of the ground or reaching objects that are up high.) 3) Set up a
										specific route through/around the school or classroom that includes
										various obstacles, have a specific goal in mind such as retrieving a
										book from the library or getting their lunch in the cafeteria. 4)
										Schedule the activity, secure equipment, and plan logistics. Step By
										Step Description: 1) Explain the activity to the students and
										demonstrate how to use a guide cane and wheelchair. 2) Have students
										maneuver a wheelchair or use a guide cane to navigate through the
										obstacles set up around the classroom or school. The other students
										should either watch or participate by becoming an obstacle (for
										example: a crowded hallway). 3) After the activity bring the students
										back together and have them discuss what they experienced and what
										they learned from the activity. Reflection Questions: 1) What are two
										words that describe how you felt during the activity? Go around the
										room and have each student share his/her two words. 2) What did you
										think about while trying to move around in the wheelchair? 3) Was it
										easy to get around the obstacles while blindfolded and using a guide
										cane? 4) Did it take longer to complete activities while you were in
										a wheelchair or blindfolded? Authors: Elementary Work Group

										Needed to Carry Out: At least six (6) students Recommended
										Setting(s): Classroom Materials Needed: AV Equipment, internet
										access, CDs, musical instruments, blind folds, cotton balls or ear
										plugs Time Needed: 60 minutes Goal: Students will learn about
										different musicians who have disabilities. Teacher Preparation: 1)

										video of Stevie Wonder: http://youtu.be/8r92A7ndnZk 3) Review video
										of Rick Allen, drummer for Def Leppard: http://youtu.be/bMyOab17LhA
										4) Select some recordings of Beethoven, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles,
										Rick Allen, and/or George Dennehy to play for the students. 5) If you
										are using ear plugs instead of cotton balls, make sure that it is
										safe to put ear plugs in students’ ears. Be aware of any unforeseen
										issues about tying the student’s arms. Remember that it is the
										student’s choice to simulate an impairment. Step By Step Description:
										1) Play the music by musicians with disabilities for students. 2)
										Select a video or clip to share with students. 3) Explain that the
										selected musicians have disabilities. 4) Give the students musical
										instruments and play as a class a commonly known song (i.e., Pop Goes
										the Weasel, Baa Baa Black Sheep, The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and
										Round). Record the class playing the song. 5) Have each student
										choose an impairment they would like to simulate (i.e., Tying their
										arm behind their back, blindfold, put cotton in their ears). 6) Play
										the song again and record. 7) Play both recordings and have class
										discussion by using the reflection questions. Reflection Questions:
										1) What do you think about the musicians with disabilities? 2) What
										do you think of the two recordings? 3) What was the difference in
										playing the instrument while having your (arm tied behind your back
										or blindfolded, or cotton in your ears)? (Emphasize that these
