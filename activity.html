								<strong>Recommended Setting(s):</strong> Classroom <br>

								<strong>Materials Needed:</strong> Noise cancelling headphones <br>

								<strong>Time Needed:</strong> 45 minutes <br>
								<hr>

								<strong>Goal:</strong> Students will learn what it feels like to have a communication challenge.
								<hr>

								<strong>Teacher Preparation:</strong>
									<ol>
										<li>Review “Definitions of Communication Disorders and Variations” by American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA).  The paper can be accessed by using the following URL: <a href="http://www.asha.org/policy/RP1993-00208/" target="_blank">http://www.asha.org/policy/RP1993-00208/</a></li>
										<li>Generate simple sentences that can be acted out without using words (i.e., I’m sleepy or I want a drink of water.) and write these phrases on pieces of paper. (NOTE: Develop a sentence for each student in the class.)</li>
									</ol>
								<hr>

								<strong>Step By Step Description:</strong>
									<ol>
										<li>Pass out the sentences to each student and ask them to read the questions to themselves but do not share them with each other.</li>
										<li>Pass out the headphones to half of the class.</li>
										<li>Ask one of the students to come to the front of the class to help demonstrate the activity.  The teacher and student will demonstrate by reading a sample question and acting it out.

								<strong>People Needed to Organize:</strong> One-Two (Physical Education Teacher) <br>

								<strong>People Needed to Carry Out:</strong> One-Two spotters and base operators.  At least 12 students <br>

								<strong>Recommended Setting(s):</strong> Gymnasium <br>

								<strong>Materials Needed:</strong> Two - 4 foot high padded cylinders with speakers, ball that emits beeping sound, bats, blindfolds, helmets, baseball gloves, a computer and projector <br>

								<strong>Time Needed:</strong> 60 minutes
								<hr>

								<strong>Goal:</strong> Students will have a better understanding of how people with vision impairments can play baseball.
								<hr>

								<strong>Teacher Preparation:</strong>
									<ol>
										<li>Review the National Beep Baseball Association Web site by using the following URL: <a href="http://www.nbba.org" target="_blank">http://www.nbba.org</a></li>
										<li>Review Beep Baseball rules by using the following URL: <a href="http://www.nbba.org/rules/index.htm" target="_blank">http://www.nbba.org/rules/index.htm</a></li>
										<li>Review the video in the step-by-step description below. </li>
										<li>Setting up the field: Set up two bases consisting of 4-foot high padded cylinders that have speakers that are 100-feet down their respective lines and 10-feet from the foul lines, with a volunteer to stand at each base (base operator). There is no second base.</li>
									</ol>
								<hr>

								<strong>Step By Step Description:</strong>
									<ol>
										<li>Show the video to the students to allow them to become familiar with the Beep Baseball: <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j77yvacmTqM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j77yvacmTqM</a></li>
										<li>Students will be divided into two teams.</li>
										<li>Once the teams are selected, students will pick two people on each team to be a ‘spotter’ and a pitcher.</li>
										<li>Students will be blindfolded except for the spotters and pitchers.</li>
										<li>One team goes on the field and the other one will be at the bat.</li>
										<li>The pitcher will throw the ball, which emits a beeping sound and the batter attempts to hit the ball.</li>
										<li>The batter is allotted four strikes (swings) before they are out. Once the ball is hit, the base operator activates one of the bases to emit a buzzing sound and the batter must identify the base and run. The runner has to reach the buzzing base before the defense catches the ball.</li>
										<li>Spotters can help by giving verbal cues.</li>
										<li>If a defensive player catches the ball before the runner reaches the buzzing base, there is no score and the runner is out. However, if the runner reaches the buzzing base before a defensive player catches the ball then the runner scores for their team. The team rotates after three outs and traditionally the game is played in six innings.</li>
									</ol>
								<hr>

								<strong>Reflection Questions:</strong>
									<ol>
										<li>Did you think it was hard to hit the ball or find the bases without your vision?</li>
										<li>Was this as fun as regular baseball? Why?</li>
										<li>What was it like to be a spotter and be the only person that has vision?</li>
										<li>How can you be a “spotter” and help your friends who have disabilities, or even the ones who do not, play baseball?</li>

								Susan- Well I guess you are not going to make it to yoga today then. <br>
								Bob <em>steps in</em>- My friend has paid for this class and according to the American’s with Disabilities Act, he has a right to go and you are legally required to make accommodations for him to do so. <br>
								Susan- Well I guess I could call my supervisor (<em>rolls eyes</em>) <br>
								Frank- Yes, please do, I would very much like to speak to them.

								<br><br>

								<em>Susan picks up the phone and calls her supervisor saying,</em> <br>
								I have a person in a wheelchair here that wants to go to yoga, because I guess people in wheel chairs do yoga, but the elevator is broken so they can’t go upstairs. <br>
								<em>She waits for a response,</em> Fine.

								<br><br>

								<em>Susan says to the kids sarcastically,</em>
								I guess since you really have to do yoga today, we will move the class to the lower level. <br>
								Frank-Thank you so much! <br>
								Susan- Whatever…
